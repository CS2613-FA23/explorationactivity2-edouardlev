### Which library my sample program demonstrates
My library demonstrates the use of automated email sending with the use of of the Nodemailer library. It is a library with the main purpose of simplifying the use of sending emails programatically.

### How to run my sample program

In order to run my sample program, you must install the library first by running the install command in your terminal: 
```console
 npm install nodemailer
```

My program uses a CSV file online (on GitHub) to import the contacts we want to send the mail to, therefore we do not need to have any additional local files other than the program.
